This is a collection of algorithms and data structures that I've collected and found useful at some point.
Some of these have sources, if I remember where they came from, I'll try to cite it.
It is time to take it from being mere scribbles in a 3-ring binder and breath some digital life into it.
Hopefully this will be as useful to others as it has been to me.

While the content is coming from a 3-ring binder, the content is in no particular order. I'll try to re-organize it in a way that makes sense, but there are no guarantees.
